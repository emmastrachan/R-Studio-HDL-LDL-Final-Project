Background
This project deals with the heritability of blood lipids. There are three types of blood lipids being observed: HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and the total count (TC) of these groups. HDL is considered “good” cholesterol because it removes excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transports it to the liver to be broken down. LDL is considered the “bad” cholesterol because builds up on blood vessel walls, creating blockages. These blockages stop blood flow to affected regions and can become very dangerous depending on where the blockage is. Blockages in the coronary arteries specifically are the leading cause of heart failure, as blockages stop nutrients and oxygen from being delivered to the heart. As a result, parts of the muscle start to die, and heart disease progresses. A triglyceride consists of a glycerol molecule bonded to three fatty acid groups. High concentrations of these in the bloodstream increase the risk of stroke, as these can clog blood vessels in the brain, causing neurological deficits. HDL, LDL, and triglycerides are all important because there are genetically linked conditions that increase a person’s risk of high LDL (familial hypercholesterolemia1) and triglycerides (familial hypertriglyceridemia2) levels. This project will use the regional heritability mapping method (RHM) to test for and determine the location of any/all significant genes associated with blood lipid levels.

Methods
This test divides the genome into regions of 100 SNPs that analyze the association of a gene to the displayed trait. The traits are HDL levels, LDL levels, triglyceride levels, and the total combined levels (of the 3). Each region is tested for a regional heritability score greater than 0. A Manhattan plot is created, using R, that shows each chromosome at a fixed point, in order to see which have the highest p values. This is done for TC, TG, LDL, and HDL. The Bonferroni correction is applied at a significance threshold of 5, and values over 5 are considered significant. For the chromosomes that have a p value above 5, an additional Manhattan plot is created to show the location of the associated gene on the chromosome. The code used to get this threshold was p.adjust(X.LogP, method= Bonferroni), however an error would not allow the line threshold to appear on the Manhattan plots. The files used were taken from a paper “Regional heritability mapping method helps explain missing heritability of blood lipid traits in isolated populations”. The analysis was performed on my MAC laptop, and the environment used was R/RStudio, as the files were .RData files. 

Results
The triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels did not show any significant association with heritability, as all p values were below the significance threshold. Chromosomes 15 and 16 are significantly associated with HDL levels, with p values above 6. The specific gene that is associated with blood lipid heritability was not identified in the paper that this project is based off; however, the SNPs that show the association were. On chromosome 15, the SNP that is associated with HDL heritability is ‘rs1532085’3. A google search of genes linked to HDL levels on chromosome 15 yielded gene LIPC as a potential identification of the associated gene. The LIPC gene is associated with lipid metabolism as well as levels in the bloodstream4. Researchers have hypothesized the LIPC gene may contribute to HDL levels5. On chromosome 16, the SNP that is associated with HDL heritability is ‘rs3764261’3. A google search of genes linked to HDL levels on chromosome 16 yielded gene WWOX as a potential identification of the associated gene. Researchers have hypothesized the WWOX gene may contribute to HDL levels6. Chromosome 19 is significantly associated with LDL levels, with a p value above 6. The LDL heritability association region on chromosome 19 was much larger than that of HDL. As a result, the association from this chromosome was from base pairs 49,455,904 to 50,999,2463. A google search of genes linked to LDL levels on chromosome 19 yielded gene APOE4 as a potential identification of the associated gene. APOE4 is the gene for apolipoprotein E, which researchers have hypothesized may contribute to LDL levels7.
